## About This Project
This project uses the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) let the user register locations. The registered locations's weather is then displayed in a table, using data from the [OpenMeteo Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com).

Documentation (and the project itself) is still a WIP.
