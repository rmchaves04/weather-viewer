## About This Project

This is a project designed in order to learn Test Driven Development.

The idea is to use (Google Maps Embed API)[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started] to select a location, and fetch it's weather details with an API. Everything is still very early in development, and any new feature plans will be updated in this README.
